Describe an algorithm for baking cookies. Assume that you have many hungry friends, so you'll want to produce several batches of cookies! Include a brief flowchart for your algorithm as well. 
In response to your peers, provide at least one adjustment to make to their provided algorithm or flowchart.

1. Acquire total number of hungry friends
2. Ask each friend how many cookies and of which variety (Chocolate Chip, Regular, M&M) they would want and gather an overall total of how many cookies to bake
3. Inquire about any dietary restrictions
4a. Calculate how many cookies will fit on a standard baking tray
4b. Calculate how many trays will fit into a standard oven
5. Collect ingredients:
    5a. Flour
    5b. Eggs
    5c. Sugar
    5d. Chocolate Chips
    5e. M&Ms
    5f. butter
    5g. baking soda
    5h. Milk
    5i. brown Sugar
    5j. Vanilla Extract
6. Pre-heat oven to 425F
7. Gather mixing bowls and make a batch per option (Chocolate Chip, M&M, Regular, Dietary Restriction)
8. Mix each bowl until batter is ready
9. Use the following pseudocode to help manage:
    total number of hungry friends = 6
    2 want Chocolate Chip, 1 wants regular, 2 want M&M and 1 is Gluten Intollerant
    # each person wants 4 cookies so we will have to bake 8 Chocolate Chip, 4 Regular, 8 M&M, and 4 Gluten Free
    # you have 2 standard baking trays that will fit in your oven that can hold 6 cookies each

    cookie_counter_list = {Chocolate_Chip:8, M_and_M:8, Regular:4, Gluten_Free:4}
    baking_tray_counts = 0
    while not finished
        for each cookie_type in cookie_counter_list
            while baking_tray_counts < 12 or not all counters == 0
                if cookie_counter_list[cookie_type] > 0
                    # pour batter on tray to make 1 cookie of cookie_type
                    cookie_counter_list[cookie_type] -= 1
                    baking_tray_counts += 1
                if cookie_counter_list[cookie_type] == 0
                    continue to next cookie_type
            # bake full trays in oven for 10-14 minutes
            timer = 12 * 60
            while timer > 0:
                timer -= 1
                sleep(1) # wait for one second
            take both trays out of the oven
            #empty both trays
            tray_counts = 0
        if any counter in cookie_counter_list != 0
            continue
        else
            finished
    serve to guests
